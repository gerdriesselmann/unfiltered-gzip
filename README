This is a GZip reponse writer for Unfiltered (https://github.com/n8han/Unfiltered).

It can be used as a drop in replacement for ResponseString, like this:

object Echo extends unfiltered.filter.Plan {
  def intent = {
      case req @ Path(Seg(p :: Nil)) => GZipResponseString(req, p)
  }
}

The GZipResponseString will check if the client supports gzip encoding and
will send the required headers.
